# Tic-Tac-Toe with an Unbeatable AI

This project is a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game built with React, featuring a challenging AI opponent that is impossible to beat. The AI is implemented using the minimax algorithm, which guarantees it will always make the optimal move.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Unbeatable AI:** Play against a computer that will never lose.
*   **Modern UI:** A clean and simple interface built with React.
*   **Responsive Design:** Play on any device, from your desktop to your phone.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

*   npm
    ```sh
    npm install npm@latest -g
    ```

### Installation

1.  Clone the repo
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/adineshreddy/tic-toc-toe.git
    ```
2.  Install NPM packages
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
3.  Start the development server
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

## üéÆ How to Play

1.  The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2.  You are **X**, and the computer is **O**.
3.  The first player to get three of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
4.  If all nine squares are filled and no one has three in a row, the game is a draw.

## ü§ñ The AI

The AI uses the minimax algorithm to determine the best possible move. Minimax is a recursive algorithm that is used in decision-making and game theory. It provides an optimal move for the player assuming that the opponent is also playing optimally.

In the context of Tic-Tac-Toe, the minimax algorithm allows the AI to look ahead at all possible moves and choose the one that will lead to a win or, if a win is not possible, a draw.
